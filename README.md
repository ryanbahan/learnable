### Hey! Learnable is currently undergoing maintenance as we migrate our backend to AWS and auth0. Due to this, features are limited and you may experience some bugs or unusual performace, with limited PWA functionality. We expect to have the app back up and running by the first week of July. Thanks for bearing with us!

### 1. Abstract

As a software developer, there is always more to learn, and many of us find ourselves with folders full of interesting articles, videos, and podcasts that we'd love to learn from yet somehow never get to. Managing tabs and windows is obnoxious and bookmarks never get maintained. Learnable helps you trim the fat and finish what you started.
